## 📝 Description
This repo is my personal **Machine Learning learning space**, where I store:

- 🧪 **Practice exercises** from a beginner-friendly Udemy ML course  
- 🖼️ **NotebookLM-generated infographics** that simplify tough ideas  
- 📘 **Notes and explanations** inspired by two books:  
  - *Introduction to Machine Learning*  
  - *Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners*

Everything here is written in a simple, easy-to-understand way because I'm learning ML step by step and building my foundation slowly.
